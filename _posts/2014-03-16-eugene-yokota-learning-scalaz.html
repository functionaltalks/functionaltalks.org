<p>Eugene Yokota (<a href="http://twitter.com/eed3si9n">@eed3si9n</a>) runs a blog called <a href="http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/">learning Scalaz</a> where he has documented honestly and thoroughly his experience approaching pure functional programming in Scala. It is a wonderful goto for Scalaz, especially the <a href="http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/scalaz-cheatsheet.html">cheat sheet</a>.</p>
<p>In this talk he describes his learning process and how he has approached Scalaz, sharing his insights and his favourite resources. Unsurprisingly the best approach he recommends is trying it out yourself and playing with the REPL.</p>
<p>If you are learning Scalaz you may also be interested in <a href="http://functionaltalks.org/2013/05/27/nick-partridge-scalaz/">Nick Partridgeâ€™s great intro to Scalaz</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="https://thenewcircle.com/s/post/1578/learning_scalaz_eugene_yokota_video">here on NewCircle</a>.</p>
