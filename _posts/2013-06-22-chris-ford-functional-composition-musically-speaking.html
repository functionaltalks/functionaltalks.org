<p>Chris Ford (<a href="http://twitter.com/ctford">@ctford</a>) says, “Clojure is not the art, it is the easel, it is the paint.” What is the art, is the music which Chris masterfully pieces together with function composition in Clojure. This is a mesmerising talk performed by a virtuoso with an in-depth knowledge of both music and functional programming.</p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="http://youtu.be/Mfsnlbd-4xQ">here on YouTube</a> and the source can be <a href="https://github.com/ctford/functional-composition/tree/ClojureConj-2012">found on github</a>.</p>
