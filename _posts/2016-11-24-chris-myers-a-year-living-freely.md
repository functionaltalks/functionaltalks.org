Chris Myers ([@cwmyers](http://twitter.com/cwmyers)) talks us through how REA Group has adopted functional programming in Scala and what role the Free monad has had to play in that process.  This experience report is a frank look at the hurdles getting FP into the organisation and shows how a little bit of category theory can go a long way.

He briefly covers the mechanics of the Free monad and the interpreter pattern but largely looks at how a year with the Free monad has allowed REA to make novice teams productive while they learn and embrace FP and Scala.
