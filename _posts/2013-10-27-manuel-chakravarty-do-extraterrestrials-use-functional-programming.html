<p>Manuel Chakravarty (<a href="http://twitter.com/TacticalGrace">@TacticalGrace</a>) answers the question, was functional programming invented or was it discovered? He argues that it was in fact discovered and therefore if aliens were to visit us they were be aware of functional programming just as much as the law of gravity or relativity. Why they steal our underwear from the clothes line is still a mystery.</p>
<p>The slides are hard to see in the video so it is probably best having the slide deck open while you watch.</p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="http://youtu.be/gUZYHo_nrVU">here on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mchakravarty/do-extraterrestrials-use-functional-programming">the slides here</a>.</p>
