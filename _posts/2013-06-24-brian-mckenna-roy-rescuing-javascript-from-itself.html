<p>Brian McKenna (<a href="http://twitter.com/puffnfresh">@puffnfresh</a>) is a man who thinks that JavaScript rightly sucks. Fortunately for us, he was prepared to do something about it. Generations to come will thank him. Enter <a href="http://roy.brianmckenna.org">Roy</a>, an <a href="http://altjs.org">altJS</a> language - that is, a language that compiles down to pure JavaScript. Brian talks through this Haskell-like language which amongst other features is immutable.</p>
<p>Brianâ€™s day job is being a Scala/JavaScript dev at <a href="http://precog.com">Precog</a>, where he makes BigData obey. He is also the author of <a href="https://github.com/puffnfresh/fantasy-land">Fantasy Land</a> and <a href="http://bilby.brianmckenna.org">bilby.js</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="http://youtu.be/w3ML8wlt1oU">here on YouTube</a>.</p>
