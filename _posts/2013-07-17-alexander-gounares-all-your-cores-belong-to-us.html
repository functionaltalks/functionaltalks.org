<p>Alexander Gounares seems like a rather enterprising chap. He has started a company that is doing really interesting things with Erlang and multi-core programming. The journey has been far from smooth sailing however. His company discovered that (quite counter-intuitively) the more cores they threw at a programme, the worse it performed. This was due to (amongst other things) locking inside the Erlang VM. This is an interesting talk discussing how they improved the VM to perform at incredibles scales.</p>
