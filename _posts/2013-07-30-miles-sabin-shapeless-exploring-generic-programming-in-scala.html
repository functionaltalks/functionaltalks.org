<p>Miles Sabin (<a href="http://twitter.com/milessabin">@milessabin</a>) is a master of type systems. In this talk he gives an introduction to (and a brief history of) <a href="https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless">Shapeless</a> and focuses on <code>HList</code>s or <em>heterogenous</em> lists. Shapeless is an exploration into generic programming in Scala. Did you know it was possible to map a function over a <code>HList</code>? That is possibly the sound of your brain melting in awe.</p>
<p>Shapeless is quickly becoming main stream and is in products like <a href="http://spray.io">Spray</a>.</p>
<p>Miles is currently developing Shapeless full time and is also a partner at <a href="http://underscoreconsulting.com">_.underscore</a> consulting. </p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="http://youtu.be/GDbNxL8bqkY">on YouTube</a> and the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/milessabin/shapeless-exploring-generic-programming-in-scala">slides can be found here</a>.</p>
