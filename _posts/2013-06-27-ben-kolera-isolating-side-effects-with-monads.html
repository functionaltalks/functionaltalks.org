<p>Ben Kolera (<a href="http://twitter.com/benkolera">@benkolera</a>) continues what has almost become a mini-series here at Functional Talks on the <code>Reader</code>, <code>Writer</code> and <code>State</code> monads. He gives, what he describes as a “beginner level talk” which is easy to follow. He takes us on a “refactoring journey” from “imperative” code to “pure” functional code, pointing out that pure functional code needn’t sacrifice state. He uses Scala and Scalaz in his example.</p>
<p>Ben is a co-organiser of the <a href="http://bfpg.org">Brisbane Functional Programming Group</a> and a web app developer who uses Scala in his day job. He says he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…loves how static types and pure functional programming help to create code that is beautiful, concise and yet still can be reasoned about with minimal profanities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen to that.</p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="http://vimeo.com/64796627">here on vimeo</a> and slides <a href="https://github.com/bfpg/bfpg-isolating-effects-with-monads">here on github</a>.</p>
