<p>Tony Morris (<a href="http://twitter.com/dibblego">@dibblego</a>) and Runar Bjarnason (<a href="http://twitter.com/runarorama">@runarorama</a>) are giants in the functional community. Both have a long history in the functional world and are the founding programmers behind such projects as <a href="http://functionaljava.org">FunctionalJava</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz">Scalaz</a>. In this talk Tony lines dependency injection up in his sights and shows how it can be done in a "pure functional" way using the <code>ReaderWriterState</code> monad transformer. His language of choice in this talk is Scala but he shows how the concept holds in any functional language. There are a lot of concepts in this talk and may require a second if not third viewing. Either way, you will want to explore these concepts more closely by the end of the talk.</p>
<p>The talk can be found on <a href="http://youtu.be/ECPGTUa1WAI">youtube here</a>.</p>
