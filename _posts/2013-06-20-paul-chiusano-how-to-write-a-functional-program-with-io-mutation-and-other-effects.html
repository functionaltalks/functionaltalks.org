<p>Paul Chiusano (<a href="http://twitter.com/pchiusano">@pchiusano</a>) shows how we can write Functional programmes whilst having effects such as IO. He gently takes us through a typical imperative programme showing how effects can be minimised and then ultimately derives the IO monad. Paul is a co-author of <a href="http://manning.com/bjarnason/">Functional Programming in Scala</a> and has <a href="http://pchiusano.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/a-new-endeavor.html">just announced</a> that he is now a freelance Functional Programming consultant.</p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="http://youtu.be/1gZAqJA2pEk">here on YouTube</a>.</p>
