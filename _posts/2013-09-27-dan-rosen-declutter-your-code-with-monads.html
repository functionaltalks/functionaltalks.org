<p>Dan Rosen (<a href="http://twitter.com/mergeconflict">@mergeconflict</a>) does an excellent job in this talk of demystifying monads through a thoroughly practical example of how the &#8220;monad design pattern&#8221; can be used to de-clutter your code. </p>
<p>He gives a couple of examples using the Option, Validation and List monads. He notes the similarities between these examples and introduces the notion of for-comprehensions to declutter his examples even further. </p>
<p>Dan is a great communicator and this is an easy talk to watch and understand. Perfect for those investigating the power of monads. </p>
<p>You can find the talk <a href="http://youtu.be/Mw_Jnn_Y5iA">here on YouTube</a>.</p>
